# Flight App

## About Project
This project is an airline ticket buying website. React, vitejs, shadcn, tailwind, react-router-dom, axios libraries are used in the project.
This application allows users to filter, sort and view their flights in detail. Users can easily find the flights they want by selecting departure and arrival cities, dates and airlines.
Since some data is not available in the API used, I had to manipulate many data in the data. Again, I used a proxy to store and protect the API. Since the design you gave is just a screenshot, I tried to create a design as similar as possible. The design is designed responsively. Suitable for mobile use.
